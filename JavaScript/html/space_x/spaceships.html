    <h3>Falcon 9</h3>

    <p>
      Falcon 9 is a partially reusable medium lift launch vehicle that can carry
      cargo and crew into Earth orbit, produced by American aerospace company
      SpaceX. The rocket has two stages. The first (booster) stage carries the
      second stage and payload to a certain altitude, after which the second
      stage lifts the payload to its ultimate destination. The rocket evolved
      through several versions. V1.0 flew from 2010–2013, V1.1 flew from
      2013–2016, while V1.2 Full Thrust first launched in 2015, encompassing the
      Block 5 variant, flying since May 2018. The booster is capable of landing
      vertically to facilitate reuse. This feat was first achieved on flight 20
      in December 2015. Since then, SpaceX has successfully landed boosters over
      100 times. Individual boosters have flown as many as 15 flights. Both
      stages are powered by SpaceX Merlin engines, using cryogenic liquid oxygen
      and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) as propellants.

    <h3>Falcon Heavy</h3>

    <p>
      Falcon Heavy is a partially reusable heavy-lift launch vehicle that is
      produced by SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer. The rocket
      consists of two strap-on boosters made from Falcon 9 first stages, a
      center core also made from a Falcon 9 first stage, and a second stage on
      top.[8] Falcon Heavy has the second highest payload capacity of any
      currently operational launch vehicle behind NASA's Space Launch System,
      and the fourth-highest capacity of any rocket to reach orbit, also
      trailing the Saturn V and Energia. SpaceX conducted Falcon Heavy's maiden
      launch on 6 February 2018, at 20:45 UTC.[4] As a dummy payload, the rocket
      carried a Tesla Roadster belonging to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, with a
      mannequin dubbed "Starman" in the driver's seat.
